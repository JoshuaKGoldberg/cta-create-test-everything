# Development

After [forking the repo from GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ < your-name-here > /cta-create-test-everything
cd cta-create-test-everything
pnpm install
```

> This repository includes a list of suggested VS Code extensions.
> It's a good idea to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and accept its suggestion to install them, as they'll help with development.

## Building

Run [**tsup**](https://tsup.egoist.dev) locally to build source files from `src/` into output files in `lib/`:

```shell
pnpm build
```

Add `--watch` to run the builder in a watch mode that continuously cleans and recreates `lib/` as you save files:

```shell
pnpm build --watch
```

## Formatting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format code.
It should be applied automatically when you save files in VS Code or make a Git commit.

To manually reformat all files, you can run:

```shell
pnpm format --write
```

## Linting

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) is used with [typescript-eslint](https://typescript-eslint.io)) to lint JavaScript and TypeScript source files.
You can run it locally on the command-line:

```shell
pnpm run lint
```

ESLint can be run with `--fix` to auto-fix some lint rule complaints:

```shell
pnpm run lint --fix
```

Note that you'll need to run `pnpm build` before `pnpm lint` so that lint rules which check the file system can pick up on any built files.

### Linting Duplicate Packages

[pnpm dedupe --check](https://pnpm.io/cli/dedupe) is used to check for unnecessarily duplicated packages in the `pnpm-lock.yml` file.
You can run it with `pnpm lint:packages`:

```shell
pnpm lint:packages
```

### Linting With CSpell

[cspell](https://cspell.org) is used to spell check across all source files.
You can run it with `pnpm lint:spelling`:

```shell
pnpm lint:spelling
```

### Linting With Knip

[knip](https://github.com/webpro/knip) is used to detect unused files, dependencies, and code exports.
You can run it with `pnpm lint:knip`:

```shell
pnpm lint:knip
```

### Linting With Markdownlint

[Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) is used to run linting on Markdown source files.
You can run it with `pnpm lint:md`:

```shell
pnpm lint:md
```

## Testing

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) is used for tests.
You can run it locally on the command-line:

```shell
pnpm run test
```

Add the `--coverage` flag to compute test coverage and place reports in the `coverage/` directory:

```shell
pnpm run test --coverage
```

Note that [console-fail-test](https://github.com/JoshuaKGoldberg/console-fail-test) is enabled for all test runs.
Calls to `console.log`, `console.warn`, and other console methods will cause a test to fail.

### Debugging Tests

This repository includes a [VS Code launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) for debugging unit tests.
To launch it, open a test file, then run _Debug Current Test File_ from the VS Code Debug panel (or press F5).

## Type Checking

You should be able to see suggestions from [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) in your editor for all open files.

However, it can be useful to run the TypeScript command-line (`tsc`) to type check all files in `src/`:

```shell
pnpm tsc
```

Add `--watch` to keep the type checker running in a watch mode that updates the display as you save files:

```shell
pnpm tsc --watch
```
